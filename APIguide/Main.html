    <!-- What is an API-->
    <h2>What is an API, and why should I care?</h2>
      <p>
        API stands for an "application-programming interface." If you think that sounds scary, it's not. All that means is that an API is a set of specific instructions for accessing and getting "stuff" from some other application. It can be your behind-the-scenes tool for getting, and providing, specific data on the web. In the most simple terms, it's how one computer program "talks" to another program.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a user of technology, you should care to a minor degree. You should understand that an API maybe used quietly in the background when you interact with a website. For instance, a user may enter their credit card information, and that website uses an API to send that credit card number to another application for the transaction. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As an individual who is browsing a website about using an API, you should care because it will make your programming life easier. Why build everything from scratch when you can follow an API's instructions, provide their requirements, and have access to amazing data out there on the web?
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, if you were a food nut (just guessing, based off your interest in this site), would you want to plug away typing in the calories for every major food known to man? Or would you want to follow some simple, specific instructions to send a food name and quantity to the USDA's National Nutrient Database and have information returned instantly?

    <h2>I'll bite. What will you teach me about APIs?</h2>
      <p>
        Different APIs have different requirements. This will not teach you to use any and every API out there. This tutorial will, however, teach you all about the Food2Fork API in specific, and familarize you with some general concepts that you can apply after you've gained some confidence.

    <!-- What is the Food2Fork API? -->
    <h2>What is the Food2Fork API? Is it useful?</h2>
      <p>
        The Food2Fork API is like a giant cookbook. It offers access to a socially ranked recipe database, as well as a specific ingredient search.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you want to share your love of bacon with the world? You can do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you want your website to cater to allergy sensitive foodies? This search functionality will make it happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is up to you, the designer of your website, to decide how to use the  Food2Fork API. It's my job to show you how easy using this API can be!
